# "Choosing a Digital Mapping Platform for your Project"
A workshop offered by Cynthia Heider at Penn Libraries.

## Description

This session will guide participants through the pros and cons of various free and paid mapping tools and platforms like Google MyMaps, StoryMapJS, ZeeMaps, Felt, MapBox Studio, Leaflet, and ArcGIS Online. Special attention will be paid to evaluating your own source material, needs, and priorities to find the best tool for you and your project.
